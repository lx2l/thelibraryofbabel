    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>My name is Jared, a guy who is a fan of anything he finds interesting, I won't talk too much about myself, other than I created this page as a simple form of my entertainment, it's funny to think that something so simple has a possibility of <strong>131,710,624,343,748,736</strong> possible generations. </p>
    
    <p>I also clarify that this page is not so complex, and its form does not recreate, it takes a freer direction.</p>

<p><strong>(You can tap the icon above if you want to enter the functional page)</strong></p>

   <p>The theme of the page is something that tries in a free way to make a simple concept of what The Library of Babel is. But what is the library of babel? </p>
   
   <p>"The Library of Babel" is a short story written by the Argentine author Jorge Luis Borges, included in his collection "Ficciones," published in 1944. The story presents a universe in the form of a vast library that contains all possible books, organized in an endless labyrinth. Each book in this library is a unique combination of letters and symbols, which means there are texts containing all the wisdom and history of humanity, as well as completely nonsensical works.</p>

<p><strong>Main Themes</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Infinity and Randomness:</strong> The library represents the notion of infinity in which every combination of characters has already been written. This generates a reflection on the meaning of knowledge and the search for meaning in a chaotic universe.</li>
    <li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Through the library, Borges addresses the idea that knowledge is overwhelming. While there are books that contain truths and realities, there are also many others that are absurd. This raises questions about the nature of truth and the value of knowledge.</li>
    <li><strong>The Labyrinth:</strong> The library resembles a labyrinth, symbolizing the human quest for knowledge and the difficulty of finding meaning or purpose amid the vastness of understanding.</li>
    <li><strong>Loneliness:</strong> The inhabitants of the library, who seek meaning and truth in their books, live in a state of loneliness and despair, reflecting the existential anguish of human beings.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Structure and Style</strong></p>

<p>The story is written in a philosophical and metaphorical style characteristic of Borges, using elements of science fiction. Through his prose, the author invites readers to reflect on profound questions related to time, space, and the human condition.</p>

<p>"The Library of Babel" is considered one of Borges's most emblematic works and has influenced contemporary literature, exploring concepts that resonate in philosophy, theology, and the theory of knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Why do I say there are 131,710,624,343,748,736 unique generations?</strong></p>

 <p>
        To calculate the total number of unique possible combinations in the <strong>Library of Babel</strong> code, we consider the inputs of <strong>Room</strong> and <strong>Shelf</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        We define:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>C</strong> = total number of possible characters per position (in this case, letters and digits): 36.</li>
        <li><strong>n</strong> = length of the <strong>Room</strong> field: 4 characters.</li>
        <li><strong>m</strong> = length of the <strong>Shelf</strong> field: 7 characters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The total number of combinations for <strong>Room</strong> is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Combinations for Room</strong> = <code>C<sup>n</sup> = 36<sup>4</sup> = 1,679,616</code></p>
    <p>
        The total number of combinations for <strong>Shelf</strong> is calculated as:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Combinations for Shelf</strong> = <code>C<sup>m</sup> = 36<sup>7</sup> = 78,364,164,096</code></p>
    <p>
        Finally, the total number of unique generations possible is calculated by multiplying the combinations of <strong>Room</strong> and <strong>Shelf</strong>:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Total combinations</strong> = <code>Combinations for Room × Combinations for Shelf</code> = <code>1,679,616 × 78,364,164,096 ≈ 131,710,624,343,748,736</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, the total number of unique generations possible is approximately <strong>131.7 trillion</strong>.
